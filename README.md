#JavaScript Data Structures

##Stack

This is a stack model written in CoffeeScript and compiled into Java. It can create a new stack, add a new node to the beginning (push) and take it back off (pop).

##Doubly Linked List

The Doubly Linked List links a list both going forwards and backwards. Here you can add new nodes, remove a given node, search for a specific node, and print the linked list as a string.

##Binary Search Tree

The Binary Search Tree keeps a tree of numbers that organizes incoming number by their value compared to the preceding numbers. Higher numbers are inserted to the right and the lower numbers are placed on the left. Each node can only have two values, and there are no duplicates.
