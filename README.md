#JavaScript Data Structures

##Stack

This is a stack model written in CoffeeScript and compiled into Java. It can create a new stack, add a new node to the beginning (push) and take it back off (pop).

##Doubly Linked List

The Doubly Linked List links a list both going forwards and backwards. Here you can add new nodes, remove a given node, search for a specific node, and print the linked list as a string.
